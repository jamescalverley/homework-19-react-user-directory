## Project Title
Homework-19-React-User-Directory

## Project Description
This project involved building a simple React application to display a list list of employees (and their information) with the functionality to sort and filter through the list. The user data was generated through an API and then filtered through by searching in an input form. Upon characters being entered in the form the state of the results table will be altered and the corresponding filtered results will be rendered. Upon one of the sort buttons being clicked the array of the users is run through a sort function and which changes the state of the results table which triggers the table to re-render with the sorted results.
